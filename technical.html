    <h1>Technical</h1>
    <p class="lede">I work on hybrid events, streaming, and live sound. I've been Senior Technical Producer at Splinter Faction since 2020.</p>

    <p>I've delivered online events for clients like Secret Cinema and Phillips, working with high-fidelity Zoom audio, live sound, and streaming workflows. I've also handled pre-production planning, technical rider review, crew coordination, and live show calling.</p>

    <p><strong>Live sound engineering</strong></p>
    <p>I do front-of-house and monitor mixing, work with venue sound systems, and am experienced at communicating with crew and clients to ensure the best possible show. I'm comfortable under pressure and focus on clear communication and reliable execution.</p>

    <p><strong>Audio editing and sound design</strong></p>
    <p>I work with DAWs like Ableton Live, handling MIDI and audio routing, live rig design, and troubleshooting. I do real-time audio processing and sound design for both live performance and recorded work.</p>

    <p><strong>Streaming</strong></p>
    <p>I set up and manage streaming workflows for hybrid events, ensuring high-quality audio and video delivery. This includes coordinating multiple inputs, managing bandwidth, and troubleshooting technical issues in real time.</p>
