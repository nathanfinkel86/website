    <h1>Workshops</h1>
    <p class="lede">I run community music events and teach inclusive improvisation, both one-to-one and in groups.</p>
    
    <p>I'm also available to teach remotely via Zoom or other online platforms.</p>

    <p>I enjoy working with community organisations and empowering people to play music together even (especially) if they have not done it before. I am available for hire for workshops, events, and collaborations.</p>

    <p><strong>Jam Camp at The Borderland</strong></p>
    <p>I've been involved with Jam Camp at The Borderland for 8 years, and I've been leading it for the past 2 years. I coordinate large-scale improvised performances, supporting first-time performers and helping people find their way into making music together. The focus is on creating space where everyone can participate, regardless of experience level.</p>
