## 📖 Bio Page (bio.html)
<!-- Accessed via: "Bio" button in header navigation -->

### Meta Description
<!-- Appears in: Search engine results and social media when bio page is shared -->
Brighton-based musician and technologist exploring ambient sound, participatory music, and creative systems. 20+ years experience in performance, facilitation, and technical production.

### Hero Tagline
<!-- Appears in: Hero card at top of bio page, cyan gradient background -->
Musician, technologist, and facilitator exploring ambient sound, participatory music, and creative systems with a focus on accessibility and shared listening.

### Background Section
<!-- Appears in: Large card with full biography narrative. This is your detailed story. -->

**Paragraph 1**
I'm a Brighton-based musician and technologist whose work has evolved through more than twenty years of playing guitar, bass, drums, and synths within approachable analogue/digital systems. I still chase those meditative layers but now support them with professional attention to timing, safety, and behaviour—skills honed while stage managing, venue managing, and overseeing complex festival lineups on top of my own performances. That way, the environment around the music feels as reliable as the sound itself.

**Paragraph 2**
I spend as much time shaping space for others as I do performing. I run house band rehearsals, keep jam sessions moving, and help design community-led music initiatives that welcome different abilities and comfort levels. That openness remains central to how I make, whether I'm working with Burning Nest and similar camps, producing improvised performances at festivals like Borderland, or holding quieter restorative sessions.

**Paragraph 3**
Since 2020 I've worked as Senior Technical Producer for Splinter Faction, delivering hybrid events for partners such as Secret Cinema and Phillips while pioneering high-fidelity Zoom audio, live sound, and streaming workflows. I continue to iterate on rigs that mix analogue pedals, software synths, Ableton Live, OBS/Streamlabs, VDMX, projection mapping, and custom hybrid gear so the technology feels like an extension of the performers.

**Paragraph 4**
I collaborate on GLIA, a neural-network instrument environment, integrating its rhythm and harmony engines into my live setup. I've also been learning from Gnaoua musicians in Essaouira, Morocco, where my Moroccan Jewish ancestry draws me. I'm developing two projects there: documenting my friends' Gnaoua group and creating a crossover project that blends Gnaoua ritual with electronic textures, connecting to the healing trance origins of the tradition. Accessibility, curious research, and the belief that music should help people feel heard and calm still guide everything I take on.
