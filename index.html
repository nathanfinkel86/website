          <h2>Short bio</h2>
          <div class="card pad">
            <p class="lede" style="margin: 0;">
              Nathan Finkel is a Brighton-based musician and music technologist working across live performance, facilitation, and technical production.
              He plays guitar, bass, drums and synths, and creates immersive ambient/electronic sets designed for rest and presence—using a custom hybrid analogue/digital rig to blend
              found sound, layered textures, and melodic guitar.
            </p>
            <p class="lede">
              He's been part of Limmud UK for 20 years. For 15 years as House Band guitarist, he's performed high-pressure, professional-level 
              shows with visiting artists—multi-genre material, minimal rehearsal, fast learning, and band leader/liaison responsibilities. 
              He also draws on these skills to lead workshops and facilitation work.
            </p>
            <p class="lede">
              He's managed Jam Camp—a 50-person camp at Borderland (Sweden)—for several years, handling camp leadership, pastoral care, 
              and inclusive jams. In 2025, as Musical Director & Curator, he coordinated a large-scale improvised performance for the 
              main burn with minimal notice, supporting first-time performers. Multi-year commitment with "many years of graft."
            </p>
            <p class="lede">
              Nathan also collaborates on Glia, a playful, interactive collaborative environment for music creation that runs as a VST in a DAW. He integrates Glia's rhythm and harmony
              engines into his live setup for real-time MIDI/audio interaction, and took the system on the road for successful UK shows in December 2025.
            </p>
            <p class="lede" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
              Alongside this, he’s developing teaching and recording projects, including work connected to Essaouira, Morocco, blending Gnawa rhythms with
              electronic sound design.
