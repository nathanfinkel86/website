## Bio Page

**Lede:**
Musician, technologist, and facilitator exploring ambient sound, participatory music, and creative systems with a focus on accessibility and shared listening.

**Background:**

I'm a Brighton-based musician and technologist whose work has evolved through more than twenty years of playing guitar, bass, drums, and synths within approachable analogue/digital systems. I still chase those meditative layers but now support them with professional attention to timing, safety, and behaviour—skills honed while stage managing, venue managing, and overseeing complex festival lineups on top of my own performances.

I spend as much time shaping space for others as I do performing. I run house band rehearsals, keep jam sessions moving, and help design community-led music initiatives that welcome different abilities and comfort levels. That openness remains central to how I make, whether I'm working with Burning Nest and similar camps, producing improvised performances at festivals like Borderland, or holding quieter restorative sessions.

Since 2020 I've worked as Senior Technical Producer for Splinter Faction, delivering hybrid events for partners such as Secret Cinema and Phillips while pioneering high-fidelity Zoom audio, live sound, and streaming workflows.

I collaborate on GLIA, a neural-network instrument environment, integrating its rhythm and harmony engines into my live setup. I've also been learning from Gnaoua musicians in Essaouira, Morocco, where my Moroccan Jewish ancestry draws me. Accessibility, curious research, and the belief that music should help people feel heard and calm still guide everything I take on.

**Skills & Expertise:**

1. **Performance**
   Guitar, bass, drums, synths. Live sound design, real-time audio processing, improvisation.

2. **Technical**
   DAWs (Ableton Live), MIDI/audio routing, live rig design and troubleshooting.

3. **Facilitation**
   Workshop design, structured improvisation, supporting mixed-ability groups.
