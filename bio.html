    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p class="lede">I'm a Brighton-based musician and technologist, exploring strange noises and participatory music.</p>
    
    <p>I'm a Brighton-based musician and purveyor of odd noises, whose work has evolved through more than twenty years of playing guitar, bass, drums, and synths with hybrid analogue/digital systems.</p>
    
    <p> More recently, I've been learning from Gnaoua musicians in Essaouira, Morocco, where my Moroccan Jewish ancestry draws me, and I am hoping to record a cross-over project in Essarouira with Moroccan musicians I met through a Berklee summer school in 2025. Please see the Morocco page for more information.
