    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p class="lede">Brighton-based musician and technologist.</p>
    
    <p>I'm a Brighton-based musician and technologist whose work has evolved through more than twenty years of playing guitar, bass, drums, and synths within approachable analogue/digital systems.</p>
    
    <p>I spend as much time shaping space for others as I do performing. I run house band rehearsals, keep jam sessions moving, and help design community-led music initiatives that welcome different abilities and comfort levels.</p>
    
    <p>Since 2020 I've worked as Senior Technical Producer for Splinter Faction, delivering hybrid events for partners such as Secret Cinema and Phillips.</p>
    
    <p>I collaborate on GLIA, a neural-network instrument environment, and I've been learning from Gnaoua musicians in Essaouira, Morocco, where my Moroccan Jewish ancestry draws me.</p>
