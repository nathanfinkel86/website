            <p class="lede">
              Brighton-based musician and music technologist working in live performance, facilitation, and technical production.

              Nathan Finkel is a Brighton-based musician and music technologist working across live performance, facilitation, and technical production.
              He plays guitar, bass, drums and synths, and creates immersive ambient/electronic sets designed for rest and presence—using a custom hybrid analogue/digital rig to blend
              found sound, layered textures, and melodic guitar.
            </p>
            <p class="lede">
              He's been part of <a href="https://www.limmud.org.uk/">Limmud UK</a> for 20 years. For 15 years as House Band guitarist, he's performed high-pressure, professional-level 
              shows with visiting artists—multi-genre material, minimal rehearsal, fast learning, and band leader/liaison responsibilities. 
              He also draws on these skills to lead workshops and facilitation work.
            </p>
            <p class="lede">
              He's managed Jam Camp—a 50-person camp at The Borderland (Sweden)—for several years, handling camp leadership and logistics, pastoral care, 
              and inclusive jams. In 2025, as Musical Director & Curator, he coordinated a large-scale improvised performance for the 
              main fire performance spectacle with minimal notice, supporting first-time performers. Multi-year commitment with "many years of graft."
            </p>
            <p class="lede" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
              Nathan also collaborates on Glia, a playful, interactive collaborative environment for music creation that runs as a VST in a DAW. He integrates Glia's rhythm and harmony
              engines into his live setup for real-time MIDI/audio interaction, and took the system on the road for successful UK shows in December 2025.
              Alongside this, he's developing teaching and recording projects, including work connected to Essaouira, Morocco, blending Gnawa rhythms with electronic sound design.
