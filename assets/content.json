      "p1": "Nathan Finkel is a Brighton-based musician and AV technologist working across live performance, facilitation, and technical production. He plays guitar, bass, drums and synths, and makes immersive ambient/electronic sets using a custom hybrid analogue/digital rig—combining found sound, layered textures and melodic guitar.",
      "p2": "He’s been part of Limmud UK for 20 years and has spent 15 years as an official house band guitarist and workshop leader. That work involves learning material fast, supporting visiting artists across genres, and running structured jam sessions that help mixed-ability groups play together confidently.",
      "p3": "In 2025 he was Musical Director & Curator of Jam Camp at Borderland (Sweden), coordinating a large-scale improvised performance for the main burn with minimal notice and supporting first-time performers to take part.",
      "p4": "Nathan also collaborates on Glia, a neural-network instrument environment that runs as a VST in a DAW. He integrates Glia’s rhythm and harmony engines into his live setup for real-time MIDI/audio interaction, and took the system on the road for successful UK shows in December 2025.",
      "p5": "Alongside this, he’s developing teaching and recording projects, including work connected to Essaouira, Morocco, blending Gnawa rhythms with electronic sound design."
